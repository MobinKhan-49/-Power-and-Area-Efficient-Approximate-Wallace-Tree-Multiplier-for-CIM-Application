The energy-efficient computing-in-memory (CIM) architectures have drawn much attention as the increasing demands of neural networks. Several SRAM-based CIM architectures adopt a digital implementation, using the digital adder trees (ATs) to perform in-memory multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. Compared with the analog-domain CIM, the digital CIM eliminates errors caused by analog circuits to achieve high accuracy. However, the digital AT still incurs much power and area overhead. This brief proposes a novel low-power AT solution by approximate circuit co-design. Two approximate full adder logic is substituted to the full-adders in the wallace tree structure to enhance the performance regarding consuming low power and low area . The first proposed approximate wallace tree multiplier  scheme achieves 33.05{\%} reduction in area and a 25.9{\%} where another one achieves 25.75{\%} reduction in power and 34.57{\%} reduction in area. Approximate adders effectiveness is determined  in computing DCT(Discrete Continuous Transform) of benchmark image lena where the achieved PSNR of the approximate adder is 49.81 dB that allows slide error from the exact adder but the SSIM is almost same which serves the purpose of DCT.
